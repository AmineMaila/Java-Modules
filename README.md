# Java-Modules

This repository contains my solutions to the Java modules from the 42 Network curriculum.

## About

42 is a global education initiative that offers a new way of learning technology: no teachers, no classrooms, students learning from their fellow students (peer-to-peer learning), with a methodology that develops both computing and life skills.

This repository showcases my progress through the Java programming modules as part of the 42 curriculum.

## Structure

Each module focuses on different aspects of Java programming, building upon previous knowledge and introducing new concepts progressively.
